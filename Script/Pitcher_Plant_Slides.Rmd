# Model System

I am interested in the inquiline community of Sarracenia Purpurea

# Questions

- What is the abundance of the organisms seen in purple pitcher plants?

- Which Organisms have the highest abundances?

- Does the number of organisms seen depend on the age of the leaf?

# Data Collection

We found 100 leaf bodies and measured the following information:

(column names or picture of excel sheet goes here)

#Lets look at one particular plant ID and the number of organisms over the age the leaf

First, we must convert the columns of interest into numerics (they are currently characters)
```{r}
#Convert columns to numeric
pitcher_plant_data$Mites <- as.numeric(pitcher_plant_data$Mites)

### rotifers and after are characters, change to numeric
```

# Next, calculate the sum of organisms for Plant Numeric ID 1
```{r}
pitcher_plant_data$Total_organisms <- 

rowSums(pitcher_plant_data[,c("ants","spiders","beetle","Mosquito","Midges","Snot","Mites")])
