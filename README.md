This repository contains the final project assignment for BIO551 at CSUN (SPRING 23).

# Background Information
- These data were collected in 2004 to 2006 at Grassy Bog in the Apalachicola National Forest.  Approximate lat/lon of 30° 10' N, and 84° 56' W.  For more exact locations, contact the authors.		
- For methods, see Miller and terHorst. 2012. Testing successional hypotheses of stability, heterogeneity, and diversity in pitcher-plant inquiline communities.  Oecologia 170:243-251.		
		
The data were collected using different methods, which are reflected by the colors of the columns		
-- white coumns identify the leaf being used and when it was sampled		
-- brown columns were physical aspects of each pitcher noted when it was censused every two weeks.		
-- yellow columns were larger species that were counted in the field.  Samples were poured into a petri dish and observed at ~10x using a dissecting scope.
-- green columns are data from ~0.5 ml samples collected in the field and brought back to the lab.  In the lab, they were counted using a 0.1 ml sample under a palmer cell, counted at 100x.  When the densities were too high, a heamacytometer was used (see Changes sheet).		
-- pink columns are bacterial abundances, obtained by taking 0.05 ml. of the sample used for the green columns, then using serial dilutions of 10-5 and 10-7 then grown on a weak Luria agar plate.  Colonies were placed into morphotypes as best we could.
